## Tips
- Scaffold out the structure of the page first and then tackle each section individually.
- Use a dark, semi-transparent background color behind the "ODIN" logo for enhanced readability.
- Set the color of the "Create Account" button to #596D48, similar to tones found in the background image.
- Apply a red border to password inputs with invalid passwords using the :invalid pseudo-class.
- Style selected inputs with a blue border and subtle box-shadow using the :focus pseudo-class.
- Test your project at different desktop resolutions to ensure it is not completely broken.
- Consider implementing JavaScript validation for checking password match if confident.
